# EEG Signal Classification
EEG signal classification with statistical feature extraction using transformation function and feature selection using Genetic Algorithm and Partical Swarm Optimization. Comparison of all the machine learning algorithms on the selected features.

## Feature Extraction
* Features are extracted using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
* From wavelate transform mean, variance, standard deviation, average power, mean absolute value and energy are calculated

## ML Algorithms
Following algorithms are used for classification using extracted features
* Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Feature Selection
Features are selected using Genetic Algorithm and Partical swarm optimization
